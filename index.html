  <div class="about_words">
  <p class="about">A computer terminal is an electronic or electromechanical hardware device that
     is used for entering data into, and displaying data from, a computer or a computing
     system. Early terminals were inexpensive devices but very slow compared to punched
     cards or paper tape for input, but as the technology improved and video displays
     were introduced, terminals pushed these older forms of interaction from the industry.
     <br><br>
      A related development was timesharing systems, which evolved in parallel and made
      up for any inefficiencies of the user's typing ability with the ability to support
       multiple users on the same machine, each at their own terminal.</p>
